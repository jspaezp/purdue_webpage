              <p>
                In order to calculate the static properties of a theoretical
                ensamble of 1000 uncharged particles, a Monte-Carlo simulation
                based approach was used to estimate the stable states in such
                ensamble. It was assumed that this aprticles suffer from
                atractive and repulsive forces dictated by the 12-6
                Lennard-Jones potential. Constant temperatures and Densities
                where used to explore the minimum energies and pressures
                generated by the ensamble after stabilization.
              </p>

              <h2>Discussion</h2>

              <h3>System equilibration</h3>
              <p>
                It is seen that in our initial run (<strong>A1</strong>) where
                positions are assumed at random as he starting point of the
                simulation and temperature (T) is set to 2.0 and density (D) to
                0.4, both Energy and Pressure values in the system come to
                equilibrium after ~20000 steps in the simulation, nonetheless it
                is to note that when changing the parameters (T = 4.0, D = 0.8;
                figure <strong>A2</strong>), the stailization takes longer,
                stabilizing after ~ 50000 steps into the simulation; it is to
                note that the values arround which the simulation stabilices
                also differ, in the first case being slightly arround
                <strong>-2350</strong> and <strong>-2550</strong>in the second;
                it is to note that the pressure is in high correlation with the
                energy, and this is due to the fact that both the virial element
                and the energy depend on the sum of forces between molecules in
                our system (equation used to calculate pressure is shown in
                <strong>Equation 1</strong>).
              </p>

              <p>
                Having such behaviour is not trivial by any means, and involves
                understanding exactly what is being modelled by the Lennard
                Jones interactions, which is the intermolecular atractions and
                repulsions of atoms in space, where atoms in really close
                proximity experience rejections and atoms in intermediate
                poximity experience atraction, as depicted in figure
                <strong>A1s</strong>; ergo, one needs to consider the two factor
                being modified, T and D; where D implies that more molecules are
                allocated in the same volume (or volume is smaller for the same
                number of molecules); therefore in this particular case where
                the reduction of the volume is not large enough for molecules to
                experience repulsion one can note the reduction if energy due to
                the increased atraction of the molecules (distances closer to
                the minimum point in figure <strong>A1s</strong>).
              </p>


              <p>
                In addition it is possible to note that the number of steps
                required to achieve equilibrium increases by the increase in
                temperature, due to the fact that the possibility of accepting a
                non favorable step increases with the Temperature
                (Equation 2), therefore by random change more
                unfavorable steps that do not decrease the energy of the system
                would be accepted and from the chemistry point of view, it is
                more likely that our system assumes states that are not as
                thermodinamically stable. As an example the largest energy
                increase in a single step in a system (which ran for 10000
                steps) that started as a continuation of our initial system
                (depicted in <strong>A1</strong>) was of 10.0925, which it that
                temperature would have the possibility of being accepted of (by
                using <strong>equation 2</strong>) of 1 in 10 to the power of 11
                at the temperature it was run (0.4) whereas it would have been
                accepted once every once every 3 to the power of 6 at twice the
                temperature (without considering the constrains in the
                calculation due to the maximum precission usable by the
                computer).

              <h3>Exploration of the State equation</h3>

              <p>
                When calculating the static properties of the system in response
                to multiple densities and pressures ( <strong>A3</strong> ) we
                where able to observe as was expected that the temperature of
                the system is positively correlated withe pressure of it; which
                could empirically be understood as a higher number of
                micro-states outside of the most stable posible conformations.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition it is to note that the relationship given my the
                density of the system is not as simple, since on one hand, the
                density of neighboring particles would have an optimum, where
                particles are not close enough to suffer from repulsive forces
                but are not far enough to stop feeling attractive forces (0.7 in
                our system); nonetheless not all temperatures allow the system
                to remain in this 'perfectly' stable state and therefore high
                temperatures do not allow the system to manifest this minimum.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding this phenomenom could be done by understanting the
                case where the temperature (empirically understood as vibration
                of atoms) is infinitely small, where no movement destabilizes
                the system, whereby this goup of interactions would take the
                system to a conformation where all particles suffer the most
                atraction to each other, nonetheless if any kind of vibration
                was added to the molecules, the atraction would decrease and the
                more agitation molecules experience would translate to a greater
                offset and therefore a higher destabilization of the system;
                which would explain why the system does not visit this optimal
                energy state a higher temperatures.

              <p>
                Unless otherwise specified the simulation for water was carried
                out by using the SPC/E model by setting an ensamble of 216
                molecules at 300k and 1 Atm of pressure, where conditions where
                stabilized by a series of runs initially involving energy
                minimization with the method of steepest descend followed by
                temperature stabilization by running an NVT simulation with
                Berendsen as a thermostat for 100ps and an NPT simulation for
                the same period of time in the simulation; Afterwards
                equilibrated systems where run as an NVT simulation using
                nose-hoover thermostat to derive the dynamic properties of the
                system for 400ps, only the last 200ps where used to make the
                calculations; all configurations files and scripts are available
                upon request.

                From the ensambles we where able to note several properties that

                one can note that there are structural chenges at several levels
                in our model system, where one can observe the changes in state
                in our model both as as a reduction in the diffussion
                coefficient as temperatures decrease (table 1) and as a shift in
                the pair coorelation curve that resembles more the one of an

                resembles previously reported values for this simple water
                molecule model; in contrast with 2.49, as published by Mahoney
                and Jorgensen (Mahoney and Jorgensen, 2001). In additional it is
                psible to compare this value with the one derived from more
                complex models of water molecules where virtual atoms are added
                to increase the resemblance to experimental properties at the
                expense of an increase computational complexity; as such the
                TIP5P model pruduces a measured value of <strong>2.62</strong>
                at the same conditions of pressure and temperature, which
                depending on the aplication might or not be neglectable (further
                emphasizing the need to choose the appropiate model depending on
                the application).

              <h4>Why not use Metropolis Monte Carlo ?</h4>
              <p>
                By definition the monte carlo methods do not sample our ensamble
              in time and as such can not provide information regarding the
              dinamic properties of the system, in other words, since it does
              not have the conception of time in the simulation; cannot provide
              information regarding processes that occur through time, such as
              diffussion.
              </p>

              <h4>Why should maximum cut offs of the interactions be smaller
                than half the box size ?</h4>

              <p>
                The answer lies in the fact that when considering a periodic
                boundary condition in our simulation, a cutoff higher than that
                would mean that an atom could exert forces with itself in the
                neighboring box, which in no way would resemble a system in the
                real world.

              <h2>Molecular Dynamics of Carbon Dioxide</h2>

              <p>
                The modelling of liquid CO2 gets to be challenging in several
                regards, first of all, it is necessary to restrict the posible
                conformations of the molecule for it to ressemble the native
                conformation as a plannar molecule, and in addition the fact
                that CO2 only acquires its liquid state at high pressure makes
                the equilibration steps challenging to accomplish (Under more
                than 5 atm of pressure and temperatures close to -60 C).
              </p>

              <h3>Approach to model the molecule</h3>

              <p>
                In order to solve the priorly mentioned problems several
                complementary approaches where used; at first the planarity of
                the molecule was modelled as a pair of entities with constricted
                distance instead of using the empiric aproach of binding carbons
                and oxygen to form the molecule; therefore the mass component of
                the molecule is given by this two massive elements and the
                charge (and inter-molecular interaction component) of the carbon
                and oxygen atoms are given by virtual sites aling this couple of
                massive atoms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Several modifications where made from the molecular dinamics
                parameters files published originally for argon molecules in
                order to make the model viable (not crash at least); Importantly
                it was required to change the reference pressure of the system;
                since liquid argon is obtainable at lower pressures as the ones
                required for CO2, on the other hand since higher temperatures
                are also required, the overall system changes much more rapidly
                than the case of Argon and as such a much finer equilibration
                ois necessary, since large step sizes and coupling coefficents
                (tau_p and tau_t) lead to the crash of the system (makes it
                'explote') when submitting the system to our particular
                conditions of 20 bar and 250k (even during the equilibration
                steps) which makes it particularly hard to test most of the
                proposed situations.

                One can get to observe that with the many modifications made one
                is able to have a stable system with the sequential use of
                energy minimization, NVT and NPT simulations (stages depicted in
                figures C1 and C2); nonetheless this stability is accompained by
                large oscilations in the measured properties despite the
                averaging over time in constant values.

                It was proven to be of ulterior importance the need to
                <strong>explicitly exclude interactions within our
                molecule</strong>, due to the fact that the lack of bonds that
                was usefull to state the planarity of the molecule does not
                exclude them from interacting electrostatically with each other.

              <h3>Annealing Simulation</h3>

              <p>
                In order to attempt to visualize a change of state in our model
                an annealing was simulated where a gradient of temperature was
                applied to the system from 250k to 200k in 500 ps and the
                properties of the system where measured, It is posible to note
                the decrease in movement of the particles, as expressed by
                pressure and energy of the system and furthermore (fig C4),
                visualization of the actual movement of the molecules is also
                provided in figure C3.

              <h3>Remarks</h3>

              <p>
                As a concluding remark it is to note that most likely this model
                is not accurate and most certainly does not resemble the
                behaviour of liquid CO2, nonetheless it proved to be an really
                interesting tool to verify the importance of sequential and
                carefully chosen equilibration steps to generate a measurable
                system.
