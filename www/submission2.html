              <p>
                In order to calculate the static properties of a theoretical
                ensamble of 1000 uncharged particles, a Monte-Carlo simulation
                based approach was used to estimate the stable states in such
                ensamble. It was assumed that this aprticles suffer from
                atractive and repulsive forces dictated by the 12-6
                Lennard-Jones potential. Constant temperatures and Densities
                where used to explore the minimum energies and pressures
                generated by the ensamble after stabilization.
              </p>

              <h2>Discussion</h2>

              <h3>System equilibration</h3>
              <p>
                It is seen that in our initial run (<strong>A1</strong>) where
                positions are assumed at random as he starting point of the
                simulation and temperature (T) is set to 2.0 and density (D) to
                0.4, both Energy and Pressure values in the system come to
                equilibrium after ~20000 steps in the simulation, nonetheless it
                is to note that when changing the parameters (T = 4.0, D = 0.8;
                figure <strong>A2</strong>), the stailization takes longer,
                stabilizing after ~ 50000 steps into the simulation; it is to
                note that the values arround which the simulation stabilices
                also differ, in the first case being slightly arround
                <strong>-2350</strong> and <strong>-2550</strong>in the second;
                it is to note that the pressure is in high correlation with the
                energy, and this is due to the fact that both the virial element
                and the energy depend on the sum of forces between molecules in
                our system (equation used to calculate pressure is shown in
                <strong>Equation 1</strong>).
              </p>

              <p>
                Having such behaviour is not trivial by any means, and involves
                understanding exactly what is being modelled by the Lennard
                Jones interactions, which is the intermolecular atractions and
                repulsions of atoms in space, where atoms in really close
                proximity experience rejections and atoms in intermediate
                poximity experience atraction, as depicted in figure
                <strong>A1s</strong>; ergo, one needs to consider the two factor
                being modified, T and D; where D implies that more molecules are
                allocated in the same volume (or volume is smaller for the same
                number of molecules); therefore in this particular case where
                the reduction of the volume is not large enough for molecules to
                experience repulsion one can note the reduction if energy due to
                the increased atraction of the molecules (distances closer to
                the minimum point in figure <strong>A1s</strong>).
              </p>


              <p>
                In addition it is possible to note that the number of steps
                required to achieve equilibrium increases by the increase in
                temperature, due to the fact that the possibility of accepting a
                non favorable step increases with the Temperature
                (<strong>Equation 2</strong>), therefore by random change more
                unfavorable steps that do not decrease the energy of the system
                would be accepted and from the chemistry point of view, it is
                more likely that our system assumes states that are not as
                thermodinamically stable. As an example the largest energy
                increase in a single step in a system (which ran for 10000
                steps) that started as a continuation of our initial system
                (depicted in <strong>A1</strong>) was of 10.0925, which it that
                temperature would have the possibility of being accepted of (by
                using <strong>equation 2</strong>) of 1 in 10 to the power of 11
                at the temperature it was run (0.4) whereas it would have been
                accepted once every once every 3 to the power of 6 at twice the
                temperature (without considering the constrains in the
                calculation due to the maximum precission usable by the
                computer).

              <h3>Exploration of the State equation</h3>

              <p>
                When calculating the static properties of the system in response
                to multiple densities and pressures ( <strong>A3</strong> ) we
                where able to observe as was expected that the temperature of
                the system is positively correlated withe pressure of it; which
                could empirically be understood as a higher number of
                micro-states outside of the most stable posible conformations.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition it is to note that the relationship given my the
                density of the system is not as simple, since on one hand, the
                density of neighboring particles would have an optimum, where
                particles are not close enough to suffer from repulsive forces
                but are not far enough to stop feeling attractive forces (0.7 in
                our system); nonetheless not all temperatures allow the system
                to remain in this 'perfectly' stable state and therefore high
                temperatures do not allow the system to manifest this minimum.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding this phenomenom could be done by understanting the
                case where the temperature (empirically understood as vibration
                of atoms) is infinitely small, where no movement destabilizes
                the system, whereby this goup of interactions would take the
                system to a conformation where all particles suffer the most
                atraction to each other, nonetheless if any kind of vibration
                was added to the molecules, the atraction would decrease and the
                more agitation molecules experience would translate to a greater
                offset and therefore a higher destabilization of the system;
                which would explain why the system does not visit this optimal
                energy state a higher temperatures.

                Unless otherwise specified the simulation fo water was carried
                out by using the SPC/E model by setting an ensamble of 216
                molecules at 300k and 1 Atm of pressure, where conditions where
                stabilized by a series of runs initially involving energy
                minimization with the method of steepest descend followed by
                temperature stabilization by running an NVT simulation with
                Berendsen as a thermostat for 100ps and an NPT simulation for
                the same period of time in the simulation; Afterwards
                equilibrated systems where run as an NVT simulation using
                nose-hoover thermostat to derive the dynamic properties of the
                system for 400ps, only the last 200ps where used to make the
                calculations; all configurations files and scripts are available
                upon request.

              <h2>Molecular Dynamics of Carbon Dioxide</h2>

              <p>
                The modelling of liquid CO2 gets to be challenging in several
                regards, first of all, it is necessary to restrict the posible
                conformations of the molecule for it to ressemble the native
                conformation as a plannar molecule, and in addition the fact
                that CO2 only acquires its liquid state at high pressure makes
                the equilibration steps challenging to accomplish.

              <h3>Approach to model the molecule</h3>

              <p>
                Several modifications where made from the molecular dinamics
                parameters files published originally for argon molecules in
                order to make the model viable (not crash at least); Importantly
                it was required to change the reference pressure of the system;
                since liquid argon is obtainable at lower pressures as the ones
                required for CO2, on the other hand since higher temperatures
                are also required, the overall system changes much more rapidly
                than the case of Argon and as such a much finer equilibration
                ois necessary, since large step sizes and coupling coefficents
                (tau_p and tau_t) lead to the crash of the system (makes it
                'explote').

                It was proven to be of ulterior importance the need to
                explicitly exclude interactions within our molecule, due to the
                fact that the lack of bonds that was usefull to state the
                planarity of the molecule does not exclude them from interacting
                electrostatically with each other.

                As a concluding remark it is to note that most likely this model
                is not accurate and most certainly does not resemble the
                behaviour of liquid CO2, nonetheless it proved to be an really
                interesting tool to verify the importance of sequential and
                carefully chosen equilibration steps to generate a measurable
                system.
