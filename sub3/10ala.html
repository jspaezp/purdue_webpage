          To depict the folding process of deca-alanine to its stable helical
          conformation, a simulation was run where a force was exerted to the
          molecule to induce its unfolding and afterwards, this force was removed
          to allow the peptide to return to its stable configuration (shown in
          <strong>Figure 1</strong>)

        <h2>Unfolding of Deca-Alanine</h2>

        <div class="container-fluid">
          <p>
            In addition, the unfolding of deca-alanine was simulated by exerting
            a pull to the extremes of the molecule. This generated its unfolding
            , which can be visualized in several ways, as a first approach
            one can express this unfolding as a change with respect to the
            initial folded configuration of DA, measured by the distance between
            the extremes of the alanine chain, <strong>Figure 2</strong>.
            Nonetheless this depiction is fairly crude and much more information
            can be obtained through other depictions of the process, as it is
            the force required for each step in the deformation to occur
            <strong>Figure 3</strong>, where a change in the 'force regime'
            occurs when all hydrogen bonds are broken and further force only
            strains angles and torsions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition it is posible to observe the manner in which the
            deca-alanine is unfolding under a more 'structural biology'
            perspective, where the initial structure is textbook example of an
            alpha helix due to the torsion angles, stabilized by in-chain
            hydrogen bonds, therefore the unfolding of the structure implies a
            rupture of this bonds and a modifications of this angles. The
            modification of the angles and therefore change in secondary
            structure can be visualized in <strong>Figures 4 and 5</strong> by
            the distribution of torsions in the ramachandran plot as the pulling
            proceeds; this can also be seen in <strong>Fiure 6</strong> where
            the changes in secondary structure can be observed in time and
            finally the loss of hydrogen bonds can be observed in <strong>figure
            7</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a final remark it is to note that this simulations are carried
            out in vacum, where no solvent is present that could interfere with
            the structure of DA, where additional interactions should be
            considered, since H bonds could be stablished with the solvent and
            packing of the chain might not be neglectable.
