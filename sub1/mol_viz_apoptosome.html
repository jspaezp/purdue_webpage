      <h2>Apoptosome</h2>
      <p>
        Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that involves the
        organized killing of a cell by a series of proteins in a cell
        called caspases. One of the main regulators of the process is
        the assembly of the structure known as the apoptosome, which is
        a large heptameric structure composed of Apaf-1 (apoptosis
        protease activating factor 1) and cytochrome c (Fig. 5), whose function
        lies in the later activation of the pro-caspase 9 to start
        programed cell death (Yuan, 2013a).
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to fulfill its function the complex must assamble form
        its constitutive components, by which Cytochrome C, which is
        originally present in the mitochondria, binds to the loop
        regions of two beta-propeller structures in APAF1 (Fig 6). For
        the stabilization of this complex a heme group there are a
        series of reactions that need to take place, where APAF1 needs
        ATP to oligomerize and start the complex formation (Yuan,
        2013b), this ATP molecule binds deeply into the molecule with
        its purine side while exposing the phosphates to the exterior,
        which then is occluded by other members of the protein, now
        shown (Fig 7).

      <p>
        Once the initial interaction between Cytochrome C and APAF1 has
        taken place the pressence of a heme molecule in the Cytochrome
        is (suspected to be) needed to carry out an aminoacid exchange
        and acquire a functional conformation.
