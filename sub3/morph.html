      <h1>Introduction <small>Ca+2 gated channel</small></h1>

      <p>
        Most cells make use of an asymetric electrochemical potential across its
       cell membrane, this potential is commonly used for multiple processes
       such as active trasnport, driving chemical reactions or short term
       signals (as it is the case in neurons and muscles).

       Voltage gated Calcium channels are proteins found in several organisms
       and tisues, whose function lies in the permeation of calcium ions
       (normally extremelo low in concentration in the interior of the cell)
       after sensing a depolarizatino of the cell membrane. As such, the CavAB
       protein is present in cardiac muscle and plays a significant role in the
       contraction of cardiac musle (aka: hearbeat), therefore considering and
       understanding mechanism by which chemical compounds might affect this
       protein is of ulterior importance.

        Here we show how the allosteric bincing of a small molecule antagonist
      changes the conformatio of the protein to reduce the permeability of Ca
      through the channel.

            with the added small molecule antagonist, where it is posible to note that
            changes are actually modest in the structure of the protein; Nonetheless
            there is a change of almost half an angstrom in the selectiviry region of
            the protein, where the intermediate state in the channel would be less
            stable and therefore woulb be less likely to occur, and ultimately would
            lead to a decrease in conductivity for this ion.

            with the added small molecule antagonist, at the single chain level,
            where it is evident that the percieved movement is more due to the
            relative orientation of chains with each other than an actual large
            movment in the structure of the chain.

            movement that was observed in the morphing section, representing
            aperture and close of the channel, nonetheless it is to note the
            remarkable stability of the innner pore structure in comparisson to
            the outer side, where a large movment is actually observed,
            nonetheless this large movement does not necessarily imply a radical
            change in the biological function of the protein, nonetheless large
            movements in the pore would.
