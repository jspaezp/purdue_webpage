            <strong>Figure C1.</strong> Distribution of the measured free
            energy during the first 120 steps of the simple Monte Carlo,
            where it is evident the tendency of larger step sizes to
            stabilize faster (magenta), while smaller step sizes (orange)
            have the tendency to stay in higher energy states for a higher
            ammount of iterations, this due to periods of stability in
            local minima for the systems free energy.

            <strong>Figure C2.</strong> Distribution of the energy states
            in the last 2000 steps of a 2-million iteration simple Monte
            Carlo simulation for 10 replicates, 4 different step sizes
            (panes) and 4 different temperature settings (colours),
            showing how smaller step sizes do not drastically change the
            mean final energy (between-run mean energy) of the sistem but
            they do change distribution of the the energies (within-run
            variation), where smaller step sizes stabilize in narrower
            windows of local minima.

            <strong>Figure C3.</strong> Final Energy in function of the
            temperature and the step size (50 replicates and 2 milliion
            monte carlo steps), Where it is posible to show that there is
            no evident relationship in the step size used but there is an
            evident relationship with the temperature, suggesting that
            with enough time every step size could get to the minimum
            energy, and that this energy is dependent on the temperature;
            this is expected when one considers temperature as a measure
            of the internal energy of a substance, where a higher
            temperature setting would involve a higher free energy in the
            system.
