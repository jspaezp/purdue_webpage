              <h2>Potassium Channel</h2>
                <p>
                  Biological membranes are made of phospholipids, molecules that
                  present a large hydrophobic region and a small hydrophyllic
                  region, this physicochemical nature, in addition to an aqueous
                  environment favour the formation of bilayers, where the
                  hydrophobic regions are bundled together and the hydroplillic
                  region face the environment; Due to the large hydrophobic region
                  highly hidrophillic compounds do not readily cross the membrane,
                  nonetheless this permeability is necessary for some cellular
                  processes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The role of transmembrane channels is to provide stable
                  intermediate states for molecules that would not normally cross
                  the cell membrane lipid bilayer, where several factors that
                  provide thermodinamical stability to this kind of molecules can
                  be found and are evident when looking at the crystal structure
                  of such kinds of proteins (Choe, 2002).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The potassium channel of <strong>Streptomyces lividans
                  </strong> is a transmembrane protein that fulfills its role as
                  a potassium specific channel, as such there are several
                  characteristics inherent to it that are found to be extremely
                  interesting that allow this protein to fulfill its biological
                  role (Doyle, et.al 1998).
                </p>

                <p>
                  First of all, for the channel to perform its function, it must
                  be inserted in the cell membrane, and as such it must stabilize
                  its pressence in the membrane by associating its exterior, on
                  the sides with the hydrophobic tails of the membrane and the
                  lipids, which can be seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong> where it
                  is evident that aminoacids sidechains exposed to the lipid
                  bilayer are of hydripobic nature and the ones exposed to the
                  aqueous environment are of hydriphillic nature, interestingly
                  sidechains in the inteface region are of amphipatic nature,
                  where one region of the side chain is hydropboic but also
                  posseses a region where hydrogen bonding could be carried out
                  with the environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In addition it is possible to appreciate that the channel is
                  formed by four monomeric units, that ensemble due to shape
                  complementarity in addition to hydrophobic interactions among
                  the subunits <strong>Fig.2</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Regarding the channel properties of the protein it is necesarry
                  to note the interactions that stabilize charged ions in a
                  hydrohobic space, where energy must be compensated for the
                  desolvation of ions, this is carried out in two different
                  regions of the channel, <strong>Fig 3</strong> shows how the
                  ions are selected on the basis of their charge and size by
                  interacting in a narrow groove that stabilizes ions by
                  interacting with the oxygen atoms in the backbone protein's
                  backbone. In addition, past the selectivity filter, it is
                  possible to show how the net dipolar moment of alpha helices
                  also stabilizes the ions in an aqueous cavity in the multimer
                  (due to the ordered peptide bonds in the structure's backbone).

              <h2>Apoptosome</h2>
              <p>
                Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that involves the
                organized killing of a cell by a series of proteins in a cell
                called caspases. One of the main regulators of the process is
                the assembly of the structure known as the apoptosome, which is
                a large heptameric structure composed of Apaf-1 (apoptosis
                protease activating factor 1) and cytochrome c (Fig. 5), whose function
                lies in the later activation of the pro-caspase 9 to start
                programed cell death (Yuan, 2013a).
              </p>

              <p>
                In order to fulfill its function the complex must assamble form
                its constitutive components, by which Cytochrome C, which is
                originally present in the mitochondria, binds to the loop
                regions of two beta-propeller structures in APAF1 (Fig 6). For
                the stabilization of this complex a heme group there are a
                series of reactions that need to take place, where APAF1 needs
                ATP to oligomerize and start the complex formation (Yuan,
                2013b), this ATP molecule binds deeply into the molecule with
                its purine side while exposing the phosphates to the exterior,
                which then is occluded by other members of the protein, now
                shown (Fig 7).
              </p>

              <p>
                Once the initial interaction between Cytochrome C and APAF1 has
                taken place the pressence of a heme molecule in the Cytochrome
                is (suspected to be) needed to carry out an aminoacid exchange
                and acquire a functional conformation.

            <h1>Structure Refinement</h1>
            <p>
              The structure of the monomeric form of the potassium channel was
              submitted to KoBa-Min server for refinement via energy
              optimization (Rodrigues, Levitt and Chopra, 2012) where a dramatic
              increase in free energy was achievable, mainly by the addition of
              missing residues in the initial structure and refinement of bond
              lengths and andgles in the side chains of the aminoacid residues.
              As a remark it is to note that most of the missing residues where
              of hydrophillic nature, which are hard to cristalize properly in
              the contect of a membrane protein, since the majority of its
              composition is hydrophobic in nature.

                  have the tendency to stay in higher energy states for a higher

                  no evident relationship in the step size used but there is an
                  evident relationship with the temperature, suggesting that
                  with enough time every step size could get to the minimum
                  energy, and that this energy is dependent on the temperature;
                  this is expected when one considers temperature as a measure
                  of the internal energy of a substance, where a higher
                  temperature setting would involve a higher free energy in the
                  system.
