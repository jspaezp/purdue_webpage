          The simulation of the protein Lysozime was carried out by using the
          crystal structure with accession code 1AKE deposited in the protein
          data bank as a template for the initial configuration (originally
          resolved by Artymiuk, et.al 1982). It is to note that the biochemistry
          and structure of this protein is widely known due to its small size,
          solubility in aqueous environment, simplicity to purify and abundace,
          which has made it a workhorse as a test subject in the
          developement of multiple techniques that now are commonly used to
          extract information from biomolecules (as x ray crystalography or
          biomolecular NMR), all of this also makes it appealing as a test subject
          for molecular dynamics simulations, since it is posible to compare
          results from the simulations with experimental evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to simulate the protein in water, the structure was converted
          to gromacs format, solvated with 'SPC' water molecules, and subject to
          sequential steps of energy minimization (figure 1), NVT simulation to
          generate velocities (Figure 2) and finally an NPT simulation (Figure
          3).

          <h3>Discussing the movement of lysozyme</h3>

          <p>
            To evaluate the stability of our simulated protein in the system, the
            Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) with respect to the Crystal
            structure was measured at each time-point, where a lack of increase of
            this value is interpreted as a stable configuration (in addition to a
            really small value of merely 0.12, as depicted in Figure 6).
