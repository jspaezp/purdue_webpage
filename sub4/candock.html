                <p>
                    In order to simulate and predict the binding of several
                    compounds to a given protein we used the CANDOCK software,
                    which differs from commonly used programs (like autodock) in
                    the fact that it simulates the binding of the given
                    compounds by first separating the molecules into fragments,
                    as their 'rotatable' components and ten connects this
                    fragments to generate a final conformation.

                <h3>Scores of the docked compounds</h3>

                <p>
                    We docked a list of compounds (provided up) to the structure
                    of the kinase domain of FLT3 bound to quizartnib (a kinase
                    inhibitor), and we are able to appreciate the diversity of
                    binding affinities of multiple compounds, and more
                    importantly we can appreciate that compounds can associate
                    with the kinase domain without being kinase inhibitors;
                    which would imply that the classification as a kinase
                    inhibitor relies not on the binary binder-non binder
                    conception but more on the strength of the binding.

                <h3>Depiction of selected compounds</h3>

                    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="candockSidesTabHeader"> </ul>

                <p>
                    In order to appreciate which interactions lead to higher
                    binding affinities in the bindingg pocket the visualization
                    of the structures is provided of selected compounds (up)
                    where we can see that good binders (P30, 1N1 and IRE) show a
                    fairly deep integration with the pocket in addition to
                    exquisite shape complementarity, therefore we can suggest
                    that many van der waals interactions are providing the
                    strength of binding, in contrast with bad binders that show
                    a shallower binding; this notion is actually slightly
                    counter-intuitive, since one could expect the binding to
                    occur in great measure due to a few really strong
                    interactions (extremely evident hydrogen bonds or ionic
                    atractions).

                <h3>Comparisson with the Crystal Structure</h3>

                <p>
                    Since one of the compounds used was the one used to
                    crystalize the structure, we can use it to compare the
                    predicted binding to the site with the lowest potential
                    energy (the one that forms a crystal). We can appreciate
                    that the predicted binding does not correspond to the
                    binding depicted in the crystal structure, nonetheless this
                    could be cause by several factors, since the binding occurs
                    without molecular dynamics its posible that the lowest
                    energy binding site is not acually the ensamble average at
                    the temperature of crystalization. In addition it is to note
                    that several aproximations where done in order to accelerate
                    the docking process, as it is using only a percentage of the
                    viable seeds, forcing a rigid docking and using only the top
                    20 conformations to generate an ensamble average.

                <h2>Lead Optimization</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to explore the additional capacities of candock, we
                    ran the lead optimization protocol, where given a series of
                    compounds, it generates combinations that would increase the
                    binding affinities to a given protein and would reduce the
                    binding affinity to an anti-target.
