        <p>
          To depict the folding process of deca-alanine to its stable helical
          conformation, a simulation was run where a force was exerted to the
          molecule to induce its unfolding and afterwards, this force was removed
          to allow the peptide to return to its stable configuration (shown in
          <strong>figure 1</strong>)

        <h2>Unfolding of Deca-Alanine</h2>

        <div class="container-fluid">
          <p>
            In addition, the unfolding of deca-alanine was simulated by exerting a
            pull to the extremes of the molecule of DA. This generated an
            unfolding of it, which can be visualized in several ways, as a first
            approach one can express this unfolding as a change with respect to
            the initial folded configuration of DA, measured by the distance
            between the extremes of the alanine chain, <strong>Figure 2</strong>).
            Nonetheless this depiction is fairly crude and much more information
            can be obtained through other depictions of the process, as it is the
            force required for each step in the deformation to occur
            (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), where a change in the 'force regime'
            occurs when all hydrogen bonds are broken and further force only
            strains angles and torsions.

            In addition it is posible to observe the manner in which the
            deca-alanine is unfolding under a more 'structural biology'
            perspective, where the initial structure is textbook example of an
            alpha helix due to the torsion angles, stabilized by in-chain
            hydrogen bonds, therefore the unfolding of the structure implies a
            rupture of this bonds and a modifications of this angles. The
            modification of the angles and therefore change in secondary
            structure can be visualized in <strong>Figures 4 and 5</strong> by
            the distribution of torsions in the ramachandran plot as the pulling
            proceeds; this can also be seen in <strong>Fiure 6</strong> where
            the distribution of secondary structures is seen.
