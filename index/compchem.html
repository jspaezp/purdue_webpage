      <h2>Submission 0</h2>

      <h3>Experience in Computational Chemistry <small>or molecular modeling</small></h3>
      <ul>
          <li>None... (I can open pymol and fetch pdb entries to it...)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why did I take CHM 579?</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>I really believe in the power of computation and how
          multidisciplinary approaches are the future of science, and as such
          I believe that molecular modelling could complement gorgeously the
          work I eventually carry out in the wet lab</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>What I look forwards the most is to understand the limitations
          in the computational approaches that are commonly used, in
          particular regarding the prediction of small-molecule-protein
          binding</li>
      </ul>
