        <h2>Potassium Channel</h2>
          <p>
            Biological membranes are made of phospholipids, molecules that
            present a large hydrophobic region and a small hydrophyllic
            region, this physicochemical nature, in addition to an aqueous
            environment favour the formation of bilayers, where the
            hydrophobic regions are bundled together and the hydroplillic
            region face the environment; Due to the large hydrophobic region
            highly hidrophillic compounds do not readily cross the membrane,
            nonetheless this permeability is necessary for some cellular
            processes.

            The role of transmembrane channels is to provide stable
            intermediate states for molecules that would not normally cross
            the cell membrane lipid bilayer, where several factors that
            provide thermodinamical stability to this kind of molecules can
            be found and are evident when looking at the crystal structure
            of such kinds of proteins (Choe, 2002).
          </p>

          <p>
            The potassium channel of <strong>Streptomyces lividans
            </strong> is a transmembrane protein that fulfills its role as
            a potassium specific channel, as such there are several
            characteristics inherent to it that are found to be extremely
            interesting that allow this protein to fulfill its biological
            role (Doyle, et.al 1998).
          </p>

          <p>
            First of all, for the channel to perform its function, it must
            be inserted in the cell membrane, and as such it must stabilize
            its pressence in the membrane by associating its exterior, on
            the sides with the hydrophobic tails of the membrane and the
            lipids, which can be seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong> where it
            is evident that aminoacids sidechains exposed to the lipid
            bilayer are of hydripobic nature and the ones exposed to the
            aqueous environment are of hydriphillic nature, interestingly
            sidechains in the inteface region are of amphipatic nature,
            where one region of the side chain is hydropboic but also
            posseses a region where hydrogen bonding could be carried out
            with the environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition it is possible to appreciate that the channel is
            formed by four monomeric units, that ensemble due to shape
            complementarity in addition to hydrophobic interactions among
            the subunits <strong>Fig.2</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regarding the channel properties of the protein it is necesarry
            to note the interactions that stabilize charged ions in a
            hydrohobic space, where energy must be compensated for the
            desolvation of ions, this is carried out in two different
            regions of the channel, <strong>Fig 3</strong> shows how the
            ions are selected on the basis of their charge and size by
            interacting in a narrow groove that stabilizes ions by
            interacting with the oxygen atoms in the backbone protein's
            backbone. In addition, past the selectivity filter, it is
            possible to show how the net dipolar moment of alpha helices
            also stabilizes the ions in an aqueous cavity in the multimer
            (due to the ordered peptide bonds in the structure's backbone).
